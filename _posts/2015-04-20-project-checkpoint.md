## Revisiting the Schedule

Below we have reproduced our original schedule, with annotations in _italics_
describing what we have accomplished.

- __Sunday, April 12__
    - Implement a parallel, minimum working product of the Sequence interface
        - This will allow us to begin implementing algorithms that use the library.
    - _This milestone is complete. We have a working, preliminary implementation
       of the Sequence library in C++ using OpenMPI._
- __Sunday, April 19__
    - Implement basic versions of the example applications we'd like to
      experiment on.
        - Progress on optimizing our code can't happen until we have a basic
          working implementation for both the library and application.
    - _This milestone is also complete. We have a working implementation of the
      Mandelbrot fractal generation algorithm as well as an algorithm that
      simulates determining whether sequences of parenthesis are well-matched._
- __Sunday, April 26__
  - Refactor the implementations of both the library and application code, using
    improvements and tweaks in one to bolster performance in the other.
- __Sunday, March 3__
  - Write scripts to analyze the network topology of our system and minimize
    communication costs.
- __Sunday, March 10__
  - Collect and analyze the results of our application code with respect to
    popular alternative implementations.

As you can see, we're almost exactly where we anticipated we'd be at this point
in the project.
