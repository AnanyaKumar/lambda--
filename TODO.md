# TODO

- get boilerplate MPI code working
  - simple "Hello, world!" application on GHC machines
- build Sequence library up from boilerplace MPI code
  - Doesn't have to be super optimized just yet
  - should contain map, reduce, scan, sort
  - at this point, make sure the overall API of the library won't change too much
- start implementing algorithms using the Sequence library
- Optimize
  - write hardware autoconfig
  - fine tune applications of Sequence library
  - fine tune implementation of Sequence library
